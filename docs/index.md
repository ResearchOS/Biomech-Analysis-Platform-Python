# Welcome to ResearchOS

This is the documentation for [ResearchOS](https://github.com/ResearchOS/ResearchOS), a Python package for scientific computing.

# Install with pip
```
pip install researchos
```

# Project Description
Scientific computing is currently fractured, with many competing standards (or lack thereof) that do not provide a common way to communicate. ResearchOS provides a generalized framework to perform scientific computing of any kind, in a modular, easily shareable format.
