# Welcome to ResearchOS

This is the documentation for [ResearchOS](https://github.com/ResearchOS/ResearchOS), a Python package for scientific computing.

# Install with pip
```
pip install researchos

# Project Description
Scientific computing is currently fractured, with many competing data standards (or lack thereof) and data processing tools that do not have a common way to communicate. ResearchOS provides a generalized framework to perform scientific computing of any kind, in a modular, easily shareable format.

The primary innovatation behind ResearchOS is to treat every single piece of the scientific data analysis workflow as an object, complete with ID and metadata. While this incurs a few lines of code overhead, the ability to have a standardized way to communicate between different parts of a pipeline and to share and integrate others' pipelines is invaluable, and sorely needed in the scientific computing community.
