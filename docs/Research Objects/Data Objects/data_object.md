# Data Objects

## Introduction
Data Objects are anything that can have a data value associated with it. They are analagous to factors in a statistical analysis. This definition is purposely vague as Data Objects are intended to be entirely user-defined, customizable, and extensible. This is the mechanism by which ResearchOS can be used to manage and analyze any type of data across any domain. For example, as a biomechanist my datasets consist of multiple Subjects who each have multiple Trials. Subjects and Trials are both Data Objects in this example. Another biomechanist may structure their dataset differently, with Subjects, Tasks, and Trials. Another scientist in a different domain, for example artificial intelligence, may have a dataset consisting of multiple Experiments which each have multiple Agents interacting with each other. In this case, Experiments and Agents are Data Objects. The point is that Data Objects are entirely user-defined and can be anything that can have a data value associated with it. The relationships between the Data Objects within one Dataset are defined by the Dataset's `schema` attribute as an edge list.
