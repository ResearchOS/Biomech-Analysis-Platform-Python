# Research Objects

## Overview
Everything within the ResearchOS framework is a Research Object. All Research Objects are stored in the database, and are accessible by using the methods provided in the ResearchOS API.

All Research Objects are one of the following:

- **Data Objects** - objects that are involved in storing data, such as a `Subject` or `Trial`. These objects are typically initialized by the [Logsheet](../Research%20Objects/Pipeline%20Objects/logsheet.md), and are used to store data that is generated by a Process. It is perhaps helpful to recognize that these objects' classes are analogous to the "factors" of a statistical analysis.

- **Pipeline Objects** - objects that comprise the steps of a data analysis pipeline, typically beginning with the [Logsheet](../Research%20Objects/Pipeline%20Objects/logsheet.md), processing data with [Processes](../Research%20Objects/Pipeline%20Objects/process.md), plotting the data with a [Plot](../Research%20Objects/Pipeline%20Objects/plot.md), and summarizing it with [Stats](../Research%20Objects/Pipeline%20Objects/stats.md).

- **Variable** - [Variable](variable.md) objects are used to store the values of variables that are used in the data analysis pipeline. Their values can be hard-coded or dynamic, and are used as inputs and outputs of the Pipeline Objects, and are associated with Data Objects.

## Implementation Details
Every Research Object needs to be created using a unique `id` as a keyword argument. If the `id` is not provided as a keyword argument, an error will be raised. This `id` must start with the two letter prefix that corresponds to the type of Research Object. Besides that, the `id` can consist of anything you want, as long as it is unique within the project.

All Research Objects have two attributes that are inherited from the Research Object class: `name` and `notes`. The `name` attribute is a string that is used to more easily recognize the object in the database, and unlike the `id` it can be changed at any time. The `notes` attribute is a string that can be used to store any additional information about the object.

No attributes besides the defaults can be added to a Research Object, and attempting to do so will raise an error. The attributes that are available for each Research Object are documented in the API documentation for that object.
