# Pipeline Objects

Pipeline Objects are the building blocks of the data analysis pipeline in ResearchOS projects. While they are technically extensible, this is not needed for most users. The following Pipeline Objects are available:

- [Project](project.md)

- [Analysis](analysis.md)

- [Logsheet](logsheet.md)

- [Process](process.md)

- [Subset](subset.md)

- [Plot](plot.md)

- [Stats](stats.md)
