Bridges are the mechanism by which packages that have been built independently can be connected to one another to form a cohesive data processing pipeline. They are defined in the `bridges.toml` file in each package's folder. A missing `bridges.toml` file in a package indicates that by default that package does not depend on any other packages. The value of any [Unspecified](../Nodes/Variables/Input%20Variables/unspecified.md) variables must then be listed in each project's `bridges.toml` file.

For example, a simple package to compute, plot, and summarize linear momentum (p) given a velocity (v) and mass (m) (`p = m * v`) may be missing a `bridges.toml` file entirely, because the package's computations are self-contained. When this package is then used in a data analysis project, that project's `bridges.toml` file will specify which variables from the other functions in the pipeline should be used as the inputs to linear momentum computations.
