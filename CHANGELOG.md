Made some more changes to config.py so that hopefully config works across dev, test, and prod environments!

Got the package to fully install, but didn't get it to run. Made changes to dev vs. prod vs. test configs, especially regarding database file locations.

Trying to make the package work when pip installing from Test PyPI. Only dist-info was installed, not the package itself.

First upload to test PyPI
